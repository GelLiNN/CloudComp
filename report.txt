#Seattle Crime Detector
##Author: Kellan Nealy

This project was necessary because it forced me to re-learn the good
techniques to parse JSON.  The easiest method I've seen so far is using the
.each function within JQuery.  Logging to the console is also super important
so you can go through your JSON objects.

The product I'm turning in is devoid of CSS styling unfortunately, but that
doesn't stop it from being awesome.  You can type in your physical address
and see crime pop up around your location, or use your browser's location
to see crime directly surrounding your computer.  I would love to add
styling code, and the ability to mouse over the map and see a brief
description of the crime, or filter by recent crimes.

A heatmap would also be cool, because the readability of a bunch of
pins popping up all over the map doesn't provide any statistical analysis.
Specifically, this would show users crime frequency in a readable way.
